 2. handling missing value
 3. data cleaning and formatting 

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

Here are the steps and insights gained from performing EDA on the video game sales dataset:
- Which titles sold the most worldwide?

- Which year had the highest sales? Has the industry grown over time?

- Do any consoles seem to specialize in a particular genre?

- What titles are popular in one region but flop in another?

### Data Analysis

These analyses and visualizations provide a comprehensive understanding of the video game sales dataset, highlighting key trends, regional preferences, and the titles that are popular in one regionbut flop in another. This information can guide decision-making in game development, marketing strategies, and targeting specific markets.


### Results

- Top-Selling Titles Worldwide

Grand Theft Auto V is by far the highest-grossing title with total sales of 64.29 million copies.
The Call of Duty series dominates the top-selling list with multiple titles, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, each selling over 30 million copies.



- Sales Trends Over Time

The highest sales in the gaming industry occurred between 2010 and 2015. This indicates a peak in the gaming industry during these years.
There appears to be a growth trend in the early 2000s, peaking around 2010-2015, and potentially stabilizing or declining slightly thereafter.

- Consoles and Genre Specialization

PlayStation Consoles (PS2, PS3, PS4): High concentration of Action and Shooter games.
Nintendo Consoles (Wii, Switch): High number of Platform and Party games, reflecting Nintendo's family-friendly and casual gaming focus.
Xbox Consoles (X360, XOne): Predominantly features Shooter and Action genres, aligning with the Xbox brand's appeal to a more hardcore gaming audience.



- Regional Popularity

 Certain titles exhibit significant regional differences in popularity:
 Call of Duty: Black Ops and Grand Theft Auto V show large sales differences across regions, being particularly popular in North America but less so in other regions like Japan.
 FIFA titles tend to have higher sales in Europe and other regions compared to North America and Japan, reflecting the global popularity of soccer.

- Release Date Impact

Games released around major holiday seasons or alongside new console launches tend to perform better, indicating the importance of timing in release strategies.

### Summary

The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the video game industry's landscape, highlighting key trends in sales, genre popularity across different consoles, and regional preferences. The dominance of certain franchises and developers underscores the competitive nature of the industry and the significant role of brand loyalty and marketing.

## Recommendation 
Based on the analysis We recommend the following actions:
- These insights can help game developers, publishers, and marketers make informed decisions about game development, release timing, and targeting specific markets or regions.
- Invest in high-quality localization to improve regional sales.
- Prioritize high-quality releases for better sales.
- Stay updated on current sales trends and adapt strategies.

### Limitations
- Some entries have missing values, especially in the critic_score and regional sales columns, which may skew analysis results.
- The dataset might not include the most recent games and sales data, leading to outdated insights
- The regional sales data is not comprehensive for all games, potentially affecting the accuracy of regional popularity analysis.
